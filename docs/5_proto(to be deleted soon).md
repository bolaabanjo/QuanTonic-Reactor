# Section 5: Mathematical Foundations of the QuanTonic Reactor

## Overview

The QuanTonic Reactor is fundamentally governed by the physics of blackbody radiation, quantum energy transitions, and AI-enhanced spectral optimization. This section formalizes the underlying mathematical models that describe how the system captures, filters, converts, and optimizes energy across the entire thermal-to-electrical pipeline. These equations provide the groundwork for our forthcoming simulation and optimization stages.

## 1. Blackbody Radiation & Modified Spectral Emission

The reactor’s Quantum Thermal Emitter (QTE) produces radiation that deviates from the idealized blackbody due to engineered emissivity functions.

The baseline spectral radiance for an ideal blackbody is given by Planck’s Law:

$$
I(\lambda, T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}} - 1}
$$

Where:
- \( I(\lambda, T) \) is the spectral radiance (W·sr\(^{-1}\)·m\(^{-3}\))
- \( h \) is Planck’s constant
- \( c \) is the speed of light
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength
- \( k \) is Boltzmann’s constant
- \( T \) is the emitter temperature

For engineered surfaces, we define an emissivity function \( \varepsilon(\lambda) \), making the effective emission:

$$
I_{\text{actual}}(\lambda, T) = \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T)
$$

This emissivity function is designed to maximize output only within the photovoltaic bandgap range.

## 2. Spectral Power Integration

The total power emitted within a desired spectral window \( [\lambda_1, \lambda_2] \) is:

$$
P_{\lambda_1 \rightarrow \lambda_2}(T) = \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \cdot d\lambda
$$

This formulation allows us to engineer narrowband high-intensity output, maximizing photon utility for photovoltaic capture.

---

## 3. Photon Flux Density

The number of photons emitted per unit area per second in a bandgap-sensitive range is:

$$
\Phi(\lambda, T) = \frac{I(\lambda, T)}{hc/\lambda}
$$

The total photon flux within \( [\lambda_g, \lambda_{max}] \) (where \( \lambda_g \) is the bandgap threshold) becomes:

$$
\Phi_{\text{total}}(T) = \int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{max}} \frac{\varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T)}{hc/\lambda} \cdot d\lambda
$$

This metric directly informs PV optimization via AI control systems.

## 4. Photovoltaic Conversion Efficiency

We define a generalized conversion efficiency function for a photovoltaic surface:

$$
\eta_{pv} = \frac{P_{electrical}}{P_{incident}} = \frac{\int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{max}} \eta_q(\lambda) \cdot \Phi(\lambda, T) \cdot E_{\text{photon}}(\lambda) \cdot d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \cdot d\lambda}
$$

Where:
- \( \eta_q(\lambda) \) is the quantum efficiency of the PV material
- \( E_{\text{photon}}(\lambda) = hc/\lambda \)

This equation allows performance forecasting and neural control learning for spectral tuning.

---

## 5. Thermal Efficiency (Exergy-Based)

To assess the quality of energy conversion (not just quantity), we use the exergy efficiency:

$$
\eta_{ex} = \frac{1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}}{1 + \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{T_c}{T_h} \right)}
$$

Where:
- \( T_h \): emitter temperature
- \( T_c \): PV surface or coolant temperature

This equation captures second-law constraints and entropy management in thermophotonic systems.

---

## 6. AI Control Optimization Objective

The AI agent embedded in the Adaptive AI-Coupled Photovoltaic Layer (AAPL) seeks to optimize conversion via a reward function:

$$
\text{maximize } R(t) = \eta_{pv}(t) - \alpha \cdot \Delta T(t) - \beta \cdot \sigma(t)
$$

Where:
- \( R(t) \): instantaneous reward
- \( \eta_{pv}(t) \): real-time photovoltaic efficiency
- \( \Delta T(t) \): thermal gradient cost
- \( \sigma(t) \): spectral deviation penalty
- \( \alpha, \beta \): tunable weights

This function allows reinforcement learning or genetic optimization methods to autonomously tune performance.
