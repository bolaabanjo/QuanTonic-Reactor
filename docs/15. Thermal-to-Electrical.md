# Section 15 – Corrected Thermal-to-Electrical Efficiency Simulation  
Date: 2025-07-09  
Simulation: Thermophotonic energy conversion efficiency using TPV cell  
Status: Resolved (after modeling anomaly)

---

## Objective

To re-run the QT-Reactor thermal-to-electrical efficiency simulation using **physically realistic efficiency constraints**, correcting the previous anomaly where the electrical output exceeded thermal input due to idealized quantum current assumptions.

## Parameters

| Parameter              | Value           |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Emitter Area           | 1.0 m²           |
| Emitter Temperature    | 1800 K           |
| Thermal Input          | 595,253 W        |
| Filtered Spectral Range| 0.4 – 2.1 μm     |
| Filtered Radiative Power | 6,917.79 W     |
| TPV Efficiency (η)     | 35%              |

## Corrected Calculation

```text
Electrical Output = η × Filtered Power  
                  = 0.35 × 6,917.79  
                  = 2,421.23 W

Waste Heat = Thermal Input – Electrical Output  
           = 595,253 – 2,421.23  
           = 592,831.77 W

Overall Efficiency = (Electrical / Thermal Input) × 100  
                   ≈ 0.41%

This correction aligns the simulation with thermodynamic reality and places the system within the expected performance range of first-generation selective TPV reactors.

## Visual Output

![Energy Distribution](../plots/QT_Reactor_Energy_Distribution_Corrected.png)

> The QT-Reactor emits 99.59% of its thermal input as waste heat while converting 0.41% into usable electricity via thermophotonic conversion.

## Notes

- The prior simulation used an idealized quantum-limit current density (~13.48 MA/m²), which exaggerated electrical output and violated the first law of thermodynamics.  
- This version replaces that with an **industry-achievable TPV efficiency of 35%**, directly applied to the spectrally filtered radiative power.  
- The corrected simulation demonstrates real-world behavior and sets a baseline for future optimization.
