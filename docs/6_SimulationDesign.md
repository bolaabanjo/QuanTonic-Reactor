# Section 6: Simulation Design & Virtual Modeling Framework

## Overview

Simulation is the critical bridge between theoretical modeling and real-world implementation. For a complex system like the QuanTonic Reactor — which integrates high-temperature thermodynamics, quantum emission behavior, spectral filtering, and AI-based photovoltaic control — simulation enables us to test assumptions, tune parameters, and visualize system behavior under variable conditions.

This section defines the simulation architecture, software stack, key parameters, input-output structure, physical constraints, and model interaction logic for the QuanTonic Reactor virtual environment.

## 1. Objectives of Simulation

The virtual modeling environment is designed to:

- Validate mathematical formulations (Section 5) through numerical experiments
- Model radiative transfer and photon flux under realistic emitter temperatures
- Simulate spectral filtering and its impact on usable photon band density
- Estimate photovoltaic conversion efficiency under different ε(λ) and Tₑ conditions
- Test reinforcement learning behaviors for system optimization
- Output efficiency, entropy flow, energy loss, and thermal gradient data

These simulations are required for publication-grade results, design iterations, and prototype justification.

## 3. System-Level Input Parameters

| Parameter           | Symbol     | Description |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Emitter Temp        | Tₑ         | High-temp emitter temperature (K) |
| PV Temp             | Tₚ         | PV surface temperature (K) |
| Bandgap             | E_g        | PV bandgap energy (eV) |
| Emissivity Spectrum | ε(λ)       | Wavelength-dependent surface emissivity |
| Filter Transmission | τ(λ)       | Spectral filtering function |
| Incident Heat Flux  | Q̇_in      | Thermal input (W/m²) |
| Surface Area        | A          | Effective radiating area (m²) |

These variables form the simulation’s initial condition set and boundary control system.

## 4. Simulated Subsystems & Modules

### A. Thermal Emitter Model

Simulates blackbody and engineered spectral output based on Planck’s Law. Integrates ε(λ) functions and temperature ranges from 1000 K to 2500 K.

Outputs:
- Spectral radiance vs. λ
- Total radiated power (W/m²)
- Photon flux distribution (Φ(λ))

### B. Spectral Filter Module

Applies τ(λ) functions to spectral outputs. Simulates wavelength-specific transmission and reflection behaviors, with adjustable bandwidth and sharpness.

Outputs:
- Filtered spectral density
- Transmission efficiency curves
- Recycled vs. passed photons

### C. PV Surface Model

Uses filtered photon input and bandgap data to estimate:
- Electron-hole pair generation rate
- Electrical output power
- Thermalization and sub-bandgap loss

Supports multi-junction behavior simulation.

### D. AI Optimization Module

A basic reinforcement learning environment will be built using PyTorch:
- State space: temperature, spectrum, PV output
- Actions: adjust filter shape, cooling rate, surface angle
- Reward: maximize η_pv - αΔT - βσ(λ)

Trained over multiple simulated "days" of thermal cycles.

## 5. Output Metrics

| Output Symbol | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| η_pv          | PV conversion efficiency |
| η_total       | Overall system efficiency (thermal to electrical) |
| η_ex          | Exergy efficiency |
| Φ_total       | Total usable photon flux |
| σ_entropy     | Spectral entropy score |
| Q_loss        | Total energy lost (W) |
| R_AI          | AI performance reward log |

These outputs will be stored in .csv and .json format, with corresponding plots.

## 6. Simulation Phases

### Phase I — Static Simulation
- Fixed input temperature
- No AI control
- Baseline spectral and PV behavior testing

### Phase II — Dynamic Input
- Varying Tₑ over time (sunrise to sunset)
- Real-time spectral response
- Filter adaptation via simple heuristics

### Phase III — AI-Integrated Simulation
- Full reinforcement learning controller
- Adaptive parameter optimization
- Daily learning cycles + performance log

Each phase will output graphical plots, energy balance charts, and parameter-performance heatmaps.

## 7. Visualization Plan

- Radiance curves: λ vs. I(λ)
- Filter curves: λ vs. τ(λ)
- Photon flux: λ vs. Φ(λ)
- PV yield: time vs. η_pv
- Reward evolution: iteration vs. R(t)
- Entropy profile: spectrum entropy across temperature states

All visualizations will be generated with Matplotlib and saved to a /visuals/ directory in the GitHub repo.

## 8. File Structure

```bash
/simulation/
├── core_math/
│   └── planck_emission.py
├── models/
│   ├── emitter_model.py
│   ├── filter_model.py
│   └── pv_model.py
├── ai/
│   └── controller.py
├── outputs/
│   ├── plots/
│   └── logs/
├── configs/
│   └── default_params.yaml
└── main_simulation.py
```

This structure ensures modular development and scalable testing.

## Next Step

We will now initialize the simulation environment by writing the Planck integrator and emissivity-driven emission module — the foundation for spectral simulation. This will form the start of Phase I: Static System Modeling.
