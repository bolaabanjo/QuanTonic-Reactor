# Section 5: Mathematical Foundations & Performance Modeling

## Overview

This section presents the core mathematical framework that governs the performance of the QuanTonic Reactor. The system converts thermal energy into electricity via a high-efficiency thermophotonic cycle composed of radiative emission, spectral filtration, and photovoltaic conversion. 

The objective here is to quantify how thermal input (at high emitter temperatures) is transformed into electrical output — and to express this transformation through integral equations, efficiency models, entropy tracking, and optimization metrics.

---

## 1. Planck’s Law and Spectral Radiance

The QuanTonic Reactor’s Quantum Thermal Emitter operates between 1000 K and 2500 K. The foundation of its photon emission model is Planck’s Law:

$$
I(\lambda, T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT}} - 1}
$$

Where:
- \( I(\lambda, T) \): Spectral radiance (W·m⁻³)
- \( h \): Planck’s constant (6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s)
- \( c \): Speed of light (3.00×10⁸ m/s)
- \( k \): Boltzmann’s constant (1.381×10⁻²³ J/K)
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength (m)
- \( T \): Emitter temperature (K)

This function determines how much energy is emitted as photons at each wavelength for a given temperature.

---

## 2. Emissivity-Weighted Radiance

To selectively enhance usable radiation, the emitter is engineered to emit photons preferentially in a target spectral range via a wavelength-dependent emissivity function \( \varepsilon(\lambda) \). This modifies Planck’s Law to:

$$
I_{\varepsilon}(\lambda, T) = \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T)
$$

This forms the basis for spectral shaping — ensuring that photons in the range useful to the photovoltaic layer are prioritized.

---

## 3. Usable Photon Flux

Only photons with energy greater than or equal to the photovoltaic bandgap contribute to electrical generation. The usable photon flux \( \Phi_{\text{total}}(T) \) is defined as:

$$
\Phi_{\text{total}}(T) = \int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \frac{\varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \cdot \lambda}{hc} \, d\lambda
$$

Where:
- \( \lambda_g \): Wavelength corresponding to the PV bandgap energy \( E_g \)
- \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \): Maximum absorption wavelength of the PV material
- \( \frac{\lambda}{hc} \): Converts radiance to photon count (photons per second per m²)

This equation estimates the density of usable photons reaching the photovoltaic layer per unit area.

---

## 4. Incident Power and Electrical Output

The total incident radiative power on the PV surface is calculated as:

$$
P_{\text{incident}} = \int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \, d\lambda
$$

The electrical output power \( P_{\text{electrical}} \) is obtained by multiplying the usable photon flux with the energy of each photon and the quantum efficiency \( \eta_q(\lambda) \):

$$
P_{\text{electrical}} = \int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \eta_q(\lambda) \cdot \frac{\varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \cdot \lambda}{hc} \cdot \frac{hc}{\lambda} \, d\lambda
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
P_{\text{electrical}} = \int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \eta_q(\lambda) \cdot \varepsilon(\lambda) \cdot I(\lambda, T) \, d\lambda
$$

Here, \( \eta_q(\lambda) \) accounts for the PV’s ability to convert absorbed photons into electrical current — ideally close to 1 in the designed spectrum range.

---

## 5. Photovoltaic Efficiency

The instantaneous photovoltaic efficiency \( \eta_{\text{pv}} \) is defined as the ratio of usable electrical power output to the total incident radiative power:

$$
\eta_{\text{pv}} = \frac{P_{\text{electrical}}}{P_{\text{incident}}}
$$

This quantity is temperature- and spectrum-dependent, and varies with changes in \( \varepsilon(\lambda) \), spectral filtering, and surface temperature of the PV layer.

---

## 6. Total System Efficiency

Beyond PV conversion, the entire system has thermal and electrical inefficiencies. The total system efficiency \( \eta_{\text{total}} \) accounts for:

- Thermal conduction loss
- Sub-bandgap transmission
- Thermalization loss (excess photon energy lost as heat)
- Filtering and AI controller energy draw

It is approximated by:

$$
\eta_{\text{total}} = \eta_{\text{pv}} \cdot \eta_{\text{spectral}} \cdot \eta_{\text{AI-control}} \cdot \eta_{\text{thermal-recovery}}
$$

Each term above can be dynamically simulated or measured under varying thermal loads.

---

## 7. Entropy and Exergy Considerations

A critical thermodynamic metric is the system’s ability to preserve exergy — the maximum theoretical work extractable from heat. For radiative systems, entropy per photon \( S(\lambda) \) increases with bandwidth and decreases with spectral compression.

Spectral entropy \( \sigma_{\text{radiative}} \) is given by:

$$
\sigma_{\text{radiative}} = -\int_{\lambda_g}^{\lambda_{\text{max}}} \Phi(\lambda) \cdot \ln\left( \frac{\Phi(\lambda)}{\Phi_{\text{total}}} \right) \, d\lambda
$$

Where \( \Phi(\lambda) \) is the normalized photon flux. Lower entropy means higher spectral order and greater conversion potential.

Exergy efficiency \( \eta_{\text{ex}} \) is then:

$$
\eta_{\text{ex}} = \frac{\text{Useful Work Output}}{\text{Exergy Input}} = \frac{P_{\text{electrical}}}{Q_{\text{in}} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}\right)}
$$

Where:
- \( Q_{\text{in}} \): Input heat
- \( T_h \): Emitter temperature
- \( T_c \): PV or sink temperature

This measure reflects how close the system operates to its reversible thermodynamic limit.

---

## 8. AI Optimization Logic

The AI feedback loop uses a reward function \( R(t) \) to optimize performance dynamically:

$$
R(t) = \eta_{\text{pv}}(t) - \alpha \cdot \Delta T(t) - \beta \cdot \sigma_{\text{radiative}}(t)
$$

Where:
- \( \eta_{\text{pv}}(t) \): Real-time photovoltaic efficiency
- \( \Delta T(t) \): Deviation from optimal PV temperature
- \( \sigma_{\text{radiative}}(t) \): Spectral entropy at time t
- \( \alpha, \beta \): Tunable weight constants

The goal is to maximize usable output while minimizing entropy and maintaining thermal equilibrium.
