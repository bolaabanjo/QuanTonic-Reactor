# Overview

The QuanTonic Reactor (QT Reactor) is a next-generation thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy system that transforms extreme heat into usable electricity through:

- **Photonic crystal emitters** engineered for spectral precision  
- **Quantum dot arrays** for tunable energy harvesting and multiple exciton generation  
- **AI optimization loops** to dynamically tune the system in real-time

The goal: radically enhance energy efficiency, eliminate waste, and lay the groundwork for deep-space, robotics, and AI-era power infrastructure.
