## Context

During the energy balance modeling in Section 15 of the QT-Reactor project, we attempted to simulate the thermal-to-electrical efficiency of the system using theoretical values derived from ideal photonic behavior.

The initial simulation was performed using a **1 cm² emitter area**, then recalculated at **1 m² scale** to align with realistic system-level power densities.

## Phase 1: Initial Anomaly

**Emitter Area:** 1 cm²  
**Emitter Temp:** 1800 K  
**Thermal Input (ideal):** ~59.53 W  
**Filtered Output:** ~0.69 W  
**Electrical Output (TPV):** 1240.05 W  

→ Calculated efficiency exceeded 179,000%  
→ Conclusion: electrical output exceeds input — violates conservation laws

---

## Phase 2: Unit Correction and Re-run

To rule out scale mismatch, we re-ran the simulation using:

**Emitter Area:** 1 m²  
**Thermal Input (ideal):** 595,253 W  
**Filtered Output:** 6,917.79 W  
**Electrical Output (TPV):** 12,940,800 W  

→ Efficiency still exceeded 187,000%  
→ Same physical contradiction persists despite corrected scale

## Root Cause

We traced the anomaly to overestimation in the electrical output, which was derived from raw quantum current density (13.48 MA/m² at 0.96 V). That estimate did not account for:

- Realistic photonic conversion efficiency  
- Non-absorbed photons  
- Carrier recombination losses  
- Heat leakage  
- Optical-electrical coupling inefficiencies

This resulted in an **unphysically high output** that overshot even the full thermal budget of the system.

## Resolution Plan

We will recalibrate the electrical output using a physically realistic efficiency range (30–50%) based on:

- TPV material properties (e.g., GaSb bandgap behavior)  
- Filtered photon flux  
- Measured quantum efficiency  
- Losses due to thermal radiation and non-conversion

This recalibrated model will be used in the finalized Section 15 and all downstream subsystems (thermal recovery, radiator sizing, recycling optics, etc).

## Why This Is Logged

Rather than deleting or hiding this modeling error, we’ve chosen to log it here to:

- Demonstrate an iterative and accountable research process  
- Serve as a reproducible checkpoint for future collaborators  
- Reinforce scientific credibility and systems engineering discipline
