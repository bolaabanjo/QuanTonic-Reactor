# Error Log – Thermal Efficiency Overestimation

## Context

While performing the energy balance simulation in Section 15 of the QT-Reactor project, we encountered a significant deviation between the projected electrical output and the calculated thermal input — exceeding physical limits.

---

## Simulation Summary

**Inputs:**
- Emitter temperature: 1800 K  
- Emitter area: 1.0 m²  
- Filtered radiative power: 6,917.79 W (6.9 kW)  
- Total blackbody thermal power: 595,253 W (595.3 kW)

**Simulated Output:**
- Electrical Output: 12,940,800 W (12.94 MW)

---

## Issue

The simulated electrical output exceeds both:

- The **filtered thermal power** (6.9 kW)
- The **total thermal input** (595.3 kW)

This leads to an efficiency > 1000%, violating energy conservation.

---

## Cause

The issue stems from using raw quantum current density (13.48 MA/m²) without compensating for:

- Non-ideal spectral absorption  
- Sub-bandgap photon rejection  
- Recombination losses  
- Heat management inefficiencies  
- Realistic system integration limits

---

## Resolution Plan

This entry is retained as a record of modeling overshoot.  
A recalibrated simulation will follow using:

- Targeted conversion efficiency range of 30–50%  
- TPV performance derived from real material physics  
- Optical + electrical coupling losses modeled explicitly

## Importance of Logging

Rather than deleting or overriding this result, we’ve chosen to log it separately to:

- Preserve the development trail  
- Show transparency in research  
- Encourage reproducibility and peer review  
- Reinforce our commitment to scientific integrity
